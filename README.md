## Physics Formulas Used

### 1. Gravitational Potential Energy (U)
\[
U = -\frac{G M m}{r}
\]
- **U**: Gravitational potential energy (Joules)  
- **G**: Gravitational constant = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2  
- **M**: Mass of Earth = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}  
- **m**: Mass of internal object (kg)  
- **r**: Distance from the center of the Earth (m)  

---

### 2. Kinetic Energy (K)
\[
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]
- **K**: Kinetic energy (Joules)  
- **m**: Mass of internal object (kg)  
- **v**: Velocity after fall/conversion (m/s)  

---

### 3. Velocity from Energy Conversion
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{2K}{m}}
\]
- Calculates the velocity an object would gain if all gravitational potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.

---

### 4. Energy Conservation (Ideal Case)
\[
|U| = K
\]
- In ideal vacuum or internal closed systems, all potential energy becomes kinetic energy without losses.
